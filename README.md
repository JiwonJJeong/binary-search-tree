# binary-search-tree
The Odin Project JS project to build, traverse, and search a balanced binary search tree.

## Achieved Learning Goals
* **Recursion**: Practiced understanding recursion to author methods requiring stacks.
* **No recursion**: Authored iterative versions of methods when possible and elegant.
* **Familiarity with BSTs**: Built and studied BST and node structure in from-scratch implementation.

## Personal Takeaways
- Use this.func() to make sure the function uses variables of the object that calls the function
