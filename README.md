# binary-search-tree
The Odin Project JS project to build, traverse, and search a balanced binary search tree.

## Skills Used
- Practice recursion logic with depth-first traversal, deleting nodes, and finding node height
- Implement iterative logic with traversal when possible
- Organize node, tree, and driver code with modules
- Debug algorithms with VSCode watch and breakpoints

## Lessons Learned
- Use this.func() to make sure the function uses variables of the object that calls the function
